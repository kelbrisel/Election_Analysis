## Instructions

#* Using a while loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", then print out a chain of ascending numbers, starting at 0.
print("How many numbers?")
range(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)
#* After the results have printed ask the user if they would like to continue.
while 
  #* If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again.
for i in range(y) print 
  #* If "n", exit the chain.

## Bonus

#* Rather than just displaying numbers constantly starting at 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.
